# learn-css-animation
As a beginner to CSS animations, I have learned some cool things and made a photo gallery üñºÔ∏è. This project repo is all about sharing that knowledge with you with a step-by-step approach. Hope you find it useful.

Please feel free to clone the repo and try running it locally. This project is also deployed with `Netlify` and you can see it running from here, [https://css-animation-fun.netlify.app/](https://css-animation-fun.netlify.app/).

You can follow this project for the future updates as I keep updating the source code. 

If you liked the work, please show the support by giving the project a star(‚≠ê).
